      "question": "Can you teach me more about dependency injection? Give me some code examples",
      "answer": "Dependency Injection is a design pattern commonly used in software development to implement loose coupling between components or classes. It allows the dependencies of a class to be provided from the outside, rather than being created within the class itself. This promotes code reusability, testability, and flexibility.\n\nIn Java, one popular framework for implementing Dependency Injection is Spring Framework. Spring provides a feature called \"Inversion of Control\" (IoC) container, which manages the creation and injection of dependencies.\n\nHere's an example of how Dependency Injection can be implemented using Spring Framework:\n\n1. Define a class that has a dependency:\n\n```java\npublic class UserService {\n    private UserRepository userRepository;\n\n    // Constructor Injection\n    public UserService(UserRepository userRepository) {\n        this.userRepository = userRepository;\n    }\n\n    // Business logic methods\n    public void addUser(User user) {\n        userRepository.save(user);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n2. Define the dependency interface:\n\n```java\npublic interface UserRepository {\n    void save(User user);\n}\n```\n\n3. Implement the dependency interface:\n\n```java\n@Repository\npublic class UserRepositoryImpl implements UserRepository {\n    public void save(User user) {\n        // Implementation to save user to a database\n    }\n}\n```\n\n4. Configure the dependencies in a Spring configuration file:\n\n```java\n@Configuration\npublic class AppConfig {\n    @Bean\n    public UserRepository userRepository() {\n        return new UserRepositoryImpl();\n    }\n\n    @Bean\n    public UserService userService(UserRepository userRepository) {\n        return new UserService(userRepository);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n5. Use the dependency in the main application:\n\n```java\npublic class MainApplication {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        ApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);\n        UserService userService = context.getBean(UserService.class);\n        \n        User user = new User(\"John Doe\");\n        userService.addUser(user);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `UserService` class has a dependency on the `UserRepository` interface. The dependency is provided through constructor injection in the `UserService` constructor. The actual implementation of the `UserRepository` interface is defined in the `UserRepositoryImpl` class, which is annotated with `@Repository` to indicate that it is a Spring-managed bean.\n\nThe dependencies are configured in the `AppConfig` class using the `@Bean` annotation. The `userRepository()` method defines the bean for the `UserRepository` implementation, and the `userService()` method defines the bean for the `UserService` class, injecting the `userRepository` bean as a parameter.\n\nFinally, in the `MainApplication` class, the Spring IoC container is initialized with the `AppConfig` class, and the `UserService` bean is obtained from the container. The `UserService` methods can then be called, and the dependency is automatically injected by the Spring framework.\n\nThis is a basic example of Dependency Injection using Spring Framework. There are additional features and annotations provided by Spring that can be used to control the scope and lifecycle of dependencies, as well as to enable more advanced dependency injection scenarios."
